Docs as Code at other conferences, video casts and articles¶
The approach has been presented at several other conferences or just video casts by different speakers.

2017

Software Architecture Summit 2017, Berlin, Germany: Gernot Starke, Ralf D. Müller: Hitchhiker’s Guide to Architecture Documentation. (Half-Day-Workshop)
2018

I’d rather be writing: Tom Johnson: Docs as code tools and workflows presentation
Greach, Madrid, Spain: Ralf D. Müller: Docs as code: arc42, AsciiDoc, Gradle & Co combined
JavaMagazin: Gernot Starke, Ralf D. Müller: Hitchhiker’s Guide to Docs as Code (German)
FrOSCon, Sankt Augustin, Germany: Christoph Stoettner: Documentation with any Editor
